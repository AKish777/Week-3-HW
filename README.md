# Week-3-HW

In week 3 homework the assignment was that we had to edit a code given to us to be able to generate a password from lower and uppercase letters, aswell as numbers and characters. The user will be able to select which characters he would like to use to generate a random password consisting from 8-128 symbols. In order to make this code work I went through a few youtube tutorials and quite a few forums to help me. This one took me multiple times to retry and figure out how to make everything work together.
